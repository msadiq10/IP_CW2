A simple Python-based application, that analyses and displays document tracking data from a major web site (issuu.com).

The web site tracks usage of the site and makes the resulting, anonymised data available to a wider audience. For example, it records who views a certain document, the browser used for viewing it, the way how the user arrived at this page etc. In this exercise, we use one of these data sets to perform data processing and analysis in Python.
